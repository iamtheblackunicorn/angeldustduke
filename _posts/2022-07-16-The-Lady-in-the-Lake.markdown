Some police officers are hardened. They see crimes of all descriptions and of all degrees of gruesomeness. Working in CID, one gets used to it. One just marks it down as another aspect of human depravity. This incident, however, was different. With all other crimes we knew that those acts of violence were committed by other humans. However, this time, nobody knew how or why Mandy had disappeared.

It all started with Mandy's parents, Mr. Warner and Mrs. Warner visiting the precinct to report their daughter as missing. Naturally, they explained what Mandy's last movements had been. Apparently she had gone into the woods for a hike. She had been missing for two days and they hadn't received a phone call concerning their daughter's whereabouts or anything indicating why she had been gone for so long. A search was started into the area that her parents thought she had gone to. Apparently, there was a specific area she liked to go to for some respite.

The search was started and yielded no results except for a rosegold iPhone 8+ that had been found on the bank of a lake. The lake was a pool large pool fed by four rivers flowing into it. Although not many lakes had currents in them, this specific one did. Surprisingly the device still worked and had a case with a pattern of roses on it. When asked, the Warners confirmed that this was, indeed, their daughter's device.

I was the Chief Investigating Officer into the case and the only lead I had was to examine Mandy's telephone for any clues that would point to what had happepend to her.

The Warners had told me that Mandy liked to do something called "vlogging" where she would record herself doing different things. Apparently she had told her parents that she had heard strange rumours about the lake and would hike to it to find out if there was any truth to the rumours. She said she would "vlog" about the whole experience. With this in mind, I opened the "Photos" app and looked for video footage.

There were a lot of pictures and a lot of raw footage. The last item in the app was a three-hour-long video dated three days ago. I clicked on it.
