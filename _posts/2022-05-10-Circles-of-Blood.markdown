## Chapter N<sup>o</sup> I: Fiona

The sun shone. The sky was blue. Fiona was lying on her couch, her hand dangling to the floor and her body heaving up and down. She was sleeping. It was early morning. She gone out the previous night and had come home late. She was still wearing her outfit from last night: A black, leather blazer, tight blue jeans, a cream-colored short-sleeved T-Shirt, and black strap-heels. She had taken off her heels because she vaguely felt her feet hurt when she had come home the previous evening.

She would have to work later that day. She was inspector for homicide investigations in the San Francisco Police Departement. Her partner, Nick, was twenty-three, about two years junior to herself. She had worked her way up in the departement and her superiors respected her for her intuition and her skill in solving crimes.

## Chapter N<sup>o</sup> II: The Call.

Fiona's telephone rang three times before it woke her. The telephone stood on a small table beside her couch, she sleepily reached over the armrest above her head and picked up. *"Yes?"*, she asked. *"Fiona! Nick here."*, Nick answered. *"How long would it take you to Pacific Heights?"*, Nick elaborated. *"About an hour, why?"*, Fiona answered sleepily. *"Long night last night?"*, Nick asked. *"Yeah, you could say that."*, Fiona explained. *"We've got a bloodbath in a big mansion in Pacific Heights."*, Nick elaborated further. *"I'll be there."*, Fiona replied. *"Pacific Heights No. 7."*, Nick answered. *"Right, thanks."*, Fiona said and hung up. She sat up gingerly, blinked and went to the kitchen sink. She poured herself a glass of water and drank it with some relish. Funny how dry one's throat felt after drinking and smoking an awful lot. She went to the bathroom to freshen up.

Fifteen minutes she got into her Chevy Camaro and set off. It would be a stressy drive to Pacific Heights. It was rush hour.

## Chapter N<sup>o</sup> III: The Black Mansion.

Half an hour later she came to the address that Nick had told her on the telephone. The driveway's gates were had two black snakes wrapped around the fence work. When her Camaro pulled up in the driveway, she stood in front of a huge black mansion with two wings with French windows overlooking the city.
